# c-13-E-commerce-ORM

## Description

UC Berkeley FullStack Coding Bootcamp provided starter code and I helped build the back end for this e-commerce site that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I contributed to this starter code to improve my understanding of the architecture of e-commerce sites. This application is not deployed and its functionality can be seen in the video link below.
